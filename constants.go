Positions on the board are represented by two characters: the first, a letter indicating the row (A, B, or C), and the second, a number indicating the column (1, 2, or 3). For example, the spot marked with an X on this board is C2:

      1    2    3
A  ... | ... | ...
B  ... | ... | ...
C  ... | X | ...
